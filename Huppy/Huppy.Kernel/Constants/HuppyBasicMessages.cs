It has many possibilities and the quality of the text generated by GPT-3 is so high that it can be difficult to determine whether or not it was written by a human!\n\n> As GPT-3 API is paid cloud service, I limited Huppy posibilities. GPT-3 training stopped at october of 2019, but it is possible to teach him new things, Sadly **training own model is expensive**, that's why this feature isn't present for Huppy.  Until OpenAI don't lower prices **I won't provide any context** of conversation for him. This option would be too expensive - probably more expensive than even training own model. Once a trial of GPT-3 ends, **I will turn on whitelist for him**, just a normal usage can get expensive when it's not limited\n\n> This all means that Huppy will not remember you, can change his mind about something and new events that happened after october of 2019 might be incorrect.";
